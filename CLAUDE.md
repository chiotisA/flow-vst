# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Setup Notes (2026-07-28)

- **Flow** — Beastsamples plugin, JUCE rebuild of a HISE prototype. See project memory for full concept/history.
- IDE: Visual Studio 2022 (2019 also installed). Formats: Standalone + VST3 only (Windows-first, no AU/AUv3/CLAP target focus yet).
- CI: Windows-only matrix (Linux/macOS entries commented out in `build_and_test.yml` — re-enable later if targeting those platforms; macOS builds happen manually on a friend's real Mac, not CI).
- Code signing: not wired into CI. Windows installer/signing is done manually via **Inno Setup** (`packaging/installer.iss`) outside GitHub Actions; the Azure Trusted Signing step is commented out. macOS signing happens manually on the friend's Mac.
- IPP: left enabled by default (not explicitly discussed yet — revisit if CI IPP install steps cause issues).

## About This Project

This project is derived from the [Pamplejuce](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce) template — a JUCE audio plugin template using CMake, C++23, and modern CI/CD. It builds cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux) with support for multiple plugin formats (VST3, AU, AUv3, CLAP, Standalone).

The template provides the build system, CI/CD, and project structure. The plugin-specific logic lives in `source/`.

## Build Commands

Visual Studio 2022, via CMake:

```bash
# Configure — generates a Builds/Flow.sln you can open directly in Visual Studio
cmake -B Builds -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"

# Build from the command line (or just hit F5/Ctrl+Shift+B inside Visual Studio)
cmake --build Builds --config Debug

# Run tests (from project root)
ctest --test-dir Builds -C Debug --verbose --output-on-failure

# Run benchmarks
Builds\Benchmarks\Debug\Benchmarks.exe
```

To debug live: open `Builds/Flow.sln` in Visual Studio, right-click the **Flow_Standalone** project → "Set as Startup Project", then F5. Breakpoints hit while audio plays through the built-in device picker — no external host needed. See [[reference-juce-resources]] for the AudioPluginHost workflow when testing actual VST3-host behavior instead.

For faster iteration than the VS generator, Ninja is an option too: `cmake -B Builds -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` (single-config, pick Debug/Release at configure time instead of build time).

## Project Structure

- `source/` - Plugin source code (PluginProcessor, PluginEditor)
- `tests/` - Catch2 test files
- `benchmarks/` - Catch2 benchmark files
- `cmake/` - CMake modules (Tests.cmake, Benchmarks.cmake, Assets.cmake, etc.)
- `modules/` - Git submodules: clap-juce-extensions, melatonin_inspector
- `JUCE/` - JUCE framework (git submodule)
- `assets/` - Binary resources (auto-included via juce_add_binary_data)
- `packaging/` - Installer resources and scripts

## Architecture

**SharedCode Library**: The `SharedCode` INTERFACE library links plugin source code to both the main plugin target and the Tests target, avoiding ODR violations.

**CMake Modules**:
- `PamplejuceVersion.cmake` - Reads VERSION file, optional auto-bump patch level
- `Assets.cmake` - Auto-includes all files in assets/ as binary data
- `Tests.cmake` - Configures Catch2 test target
- `Benchmarks.cmake` - Configures Catch2 benchmark target
- `PamplejuceIPP.cmake` - Intel IPP integration (optional)

**Test Discovery**: Uses `catch_discover_tests()` with `PRE_TEST` discovery mode for Xcode compatibility.

## Key Configuration

Edit `CMakeLists.txt` to customize:
- `PROJECT_NAME` - Internal name (no spaces)
- `PRODUCT_NAME` - Display name in DAWs (can have spaces)
- `COMPANY_NAME` - Used for bundle name
- `BUNDLE_ID` - macOS bundle identifier
- `FORMATS` - Plugin formats to build (Standalone AU VST3 AUv3)
- `PLUGIN_MANUFACTURER_CODE` / `PLUGIN_CODE` - 4-character plugin IDs

Version is read from the `VERSION` file in project root.

## Code Quality

Always resolve any compile warnings encountered during builds. Warnings should be treated as errors and fixed before considering a task complete.

Note: LSP/clangd often reports false positive diagnostic errors (like "undeclared identifier", "file not found") because it doesn't have full context of the JUCE module system. Ignore these unless the actual build fails.

## Includes

JUCE modules include common standard library headers (`<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, `<string>`, `<memory>`, etc.) so you don't need to add those explicitly in JUCE code. Adding them is harmless but redundant.

## Threading Model

JUCE plugins have two main threads:

- **Audio thread**: Runs `processBlock` — must be realtime-safe (see below). Never block, allocate, or lock.
- **Message thread**: Runs UI callbacks, parameter listeners, and timer callbacks. Owns the `MessageManager`.

To communicate between them:
- **Simple values**: Use `std::atomic` or JUCE's `AudioParameterFloat`/`AudioParameterBool` (which are atomic under the hood)
- **Larger data**: Use a lock-free queue (e.g. `moodycamel::ReaderWriterQueue`) to pass data from message → audio thread
- **Audio → UI updates**: Use `juce::AsyncUpdater` or `juce::Timer` on the message thread to poll state — never call UI code from the audio thread

## Realtime Safety

For anything in the audio thread / hot DSP path (e.g. `processBlock`):
- Allocate in constructors or `prepareToPlay`, not while rendering audio
- Avoid dynamic allocations and container growth (`std::vector::push_back`, map insertion, string building)
- Prefer fixed-size storage (`std::array`, preallocated buffers, fixed-capacity queues)
- Keep operations deterministic and lock-free where possible

## Adding Dependencies

**JUCE Modules** live in `modules/` as git submodules. Add with `git submodule add`, then `add_subdirectory` and link to `SharedCode` in `CMakeLists.txt`. Some useful ones:

- [melatonin_inspector](https://github.com/sudara/melatonin_inspector) — runtime component debugger (already included)
- [melatonin_blur](https://github.com/sudara/melatonin_blur) — fast cross-platform blurs for C++ UI (shadows, glows, frosted glass)
- [melatonin_perfetto](https://github.com/sudara/melatonin_perfetto) — performance tracing with Perfetto, great for profiling `processBlock` and paint calls
- [gin](https://github.com/FigBug/gin) — large collection of utilities (DSP, UI components, LookAndFeel, etc.)

**Non-JUCE C++ libraries** should be added via [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) which is already configured. CPM downloads and caches dependencies at configure time — no submodule needed:

```cmake
CPMAddPackage("gh:nlohmann/json@3.11.3")
target_link_libraries(SharedCode INTERFACE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json)
```

Some useful CPM libraries:
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) — JSON parsing/serialization
- [cameron314/readerwriterqueue](https://github.com/cameron314/readerwriterqueue) — lock-free single-producer/single-consumer queue, ideal for audio↔message thread communication

## Code Style

Uses `.clang-format` with Allman-style braces, 4-space indentation, no column limit.
